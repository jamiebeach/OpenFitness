  "ingredients": [
    {"name": "collard greens", "amount": "1 bunch"},
    {"name": "mixed veggies (shredded purple cabbage, carrots, cucumber, cilantro microgreens)", "amount": "a bowl"},
    {"name": "avocado", "amount": "1/2"},
    {"name": "red pepper", "amount": "1"},
    {"name": "macadamia nuts (soaked for 1-2 hrs)", "amount": "1/2 cup"},
    {"name": "water", "amount": "as needed"}
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Cut the stems off the collard green leaves and then shave the stem down using a small knife so that it's flat. This helps prevent the leaf from breaking at the end and makes it easier to roll up.",
    "Drop your collard greens in a pot of boiling water for 1-2 minutes to soften them.",
    "Thinly slice your chosen raw vegetables.",
    "Add the sliced vegetable filling to the middle-bottom of a collard green leaf 'wrap.'",
    "Carefully roll the collard green wrap just like you would with a burrito, tucking in the ends as you go so that the filling stays inside. Let these chill in the fridge while you make the red pepper dip.",
    "Cut the red pepper in half vertically and remove its core and seeds. Place the halves face down on a baking sheet and roast at 400Â°F for 20-30 minutes or until the pepper is soft.",
    "In a blender, blend roasted pepper, 1/2 cup of macadamia nuts, and a little water. Add 1 tbsp at a time until you reach the desired consistency.",
    "Pull the wraps out of the refrigerator and dip in the red pepper sauce."
